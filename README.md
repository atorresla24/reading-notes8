# Name	                Shorthand operator      Meaning
Assignment	                x = f()	            x = f()
Addition assignment	        x += f()	        x = x + f()
Subtraction assignment	    x -= f()	        x = x - f()
Multiplication assignment	x *= f()	        x = x * f()
Division assignment	        x /= f()	        x = x / f()
Remainder assignment	    x %= f()	        x = x % f()
Exponentiation assignment	x **= f()	        x = x ** f()
Left shift assignment	    x <<= f()	        x = x << f()
Right shift assignment	    x >>= f()	        x = x >> f()
Unsigned right shift 	    x >>>= f()	        x = x >>> f()
Bitwise AND assignment	    x &= f()	        x = x & f()
Bitwise XOR assignment	    x ^= f()	        x = x ^ f()
Bitwise OR assignment	    x |= f()	        x = x | f()
Logical AND assignment	    x &&= f()	       x && (x = f())
Logical OR assignment	    x ||= f()	       x || (x = f())
Logical nullish assignment	x ??= f()	       x ?? (x = f())

* Destructuring-a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to extract data from arrays or objects using a syntax that mirrors the construction of array and object literals
* Avoid assignment chains

# New 

* Creates an instance of a user defined object type or of one of the built-in object types

# Super 

* Is used to call functions on an object's parent 

## Loops and iteration

* Offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly 

# Types of loops

* for statement-repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false 
* do...while statement-repeats statement until a specified condition evaluates to false
* while statement-statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true 
* labeled statement-provides a statement with an identifier that lets you refer to it elsewhere in your program
* break statement-statement to terminate a loop, switch, or in conjunction with a labeled statement 
* continue statement-statement can be used to restart a while, do...while, for, or label statement
* for...in statement-statement iterates a specified variable over all the enumerable properties of an object
* for...of statement-statement creates a loop iterating over **iterable** objects (array, map, set, arguments)
